# ASTen
ASTen: A STandalone tENsor library for C++11. ASTen is extracted from [ATen](https://github.com/zdevito/ATen)

ASTen is a header only tensor wrapper for C++ one-dimensional array. 
I extracted ASTen from [ATen](https://github.com/zdevito/ATen) 
because ATen cannot be built on its own, see 
(https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/12452)
(https://github.com/LoopPerfect/buckaroo-wishlist/issues/116)

Currently only the simplest features of ATen are extracted.
